{"name":"Ics-openvpn","tagline":"OpenVPN for Android","body":"OpenVPN for Android\r\n=============\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n------------\r\nWith the new VPNService of Android API level 14+ (Ice Cream Sandwhich) it is possible to create a VPN service that does not root access. This project is a port of OpenVPN.\r\n\r\nRead the README\r\n---------------\r\nIf you want to develop on ics-openvpn please read the [doc/README.txt](http://code.google.com/p/ics-openvpn/source/browse/doc/README.txt) *before* opening issues or emailing me. \r\n\r\nYou can help\r\n------------\r\nEven if you are no programmer you can help by translating the OpenVPN client into your native language. [Crowdin provides a free service for non commercial open source projects](http://crowdin.net/project/ics-openvpn/invite) (Fixing/completing existing translations is very welcome as well)\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n-----\r\nYou can find the FAQ here (same as in app): http://code.google.com/p/ics-openvpn/wiki/FAQ\r\n\r\nNote to administrators\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nYou make your life and that of your users easier if you embed the certificates into the .ovpn file. You or the users can mail the .ovpn as a attachment to the phone and directly import and use it. Also downloading and importing the file works. The MIME Type should be application/x-openvpn-profile. \r\n\r\nInline files are supported since OpenVPN 2.1rc1 and documented in the  [OpenVPN 2.3 man page](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn23ManPage) (under INLINE FILE SUPPORT) \r\n\r\n(Using inline certifaces can also make your life on non Android platforms easier since you have only one file.)\r\n\r\nFor example `ca mycafile.pem` becomes\r\n\r\n  <ca>\r\n  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\n  MIIHPTCCBSWgAwIBAgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQQFADB5MRAwDgYDVQQKEwdSb290\r\n  [...]\r\n  -----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n  </ca>\r\n\r\nFotnotes\r\n-----------\r\nPlease that OpenVPN used by this project is under GPLv2. \r\n\r\nIf you cannot or do not want to use the Play Store you can [download the apk files directly](http://plai.de/android/) . \r\n\r\nIf you want to donate you can donate to [arne-paypal@rfc2549.org via paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?hosted_button_id=R2M6ZP9AF25LS&cmd=_s-xclick).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old official or main repository was a Mercurial (hg) repository at http://code.google.com/p/ics-openvpn/source/\r\n\r\nThe new git repository is now at GitHub under https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn\r\n\r\nPlease read the doc/README before asking question or starting development.","google":"UA-42824421-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
